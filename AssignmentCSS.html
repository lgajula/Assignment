                <p id="p1">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, 
                    a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
                    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
                     with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] 
                     There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] 
                     Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, 
                     less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, 
                     chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period

                <p id="p2">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

        <p id="p3">Beef cattle are cattle raised for meat production (as distinguished from dairy cattle, used for milk production). The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. In beef production there are three main stages: cow-calf operations, backgrounding, and feedlot operations. The production cycle of the animals start at cow-calf operations; this operation is designed specifically to breed cows for their offspring. From here the calves are backgrounded for a feedlot. Animals grown specifically for the feedlot are known as feeder cattle, the goal of these animals is fattening. Animals not grown for a feedlot are typically female and are commonly known as replacement heifers. While the principal use of beef cattle is meat production, other uses include leather, and beef by-products used in candy, shampoo, cosmetics, insulin and inhalers
